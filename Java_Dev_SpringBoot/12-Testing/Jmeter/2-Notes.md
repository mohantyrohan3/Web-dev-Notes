JMeter Timers

- It sends requests without applying any delay between each sampler request
- If we perform load / stress testing it will be overloaded

- Timer element can be added in a test plan to apply wait between each sampler / request

Under Thread Group only we can add Timer

- Constant Timer - Delay time between each request  , a fixed time
